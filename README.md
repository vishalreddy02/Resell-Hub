Developed a MERN Stack website, an Online Marketplace for Refurbished Goods. Users can explore various
categories such as electronics, sports, fashion, and home products to discover and purchase refurbished items.
The platform distinguishes itself by incorporating a bidding system, allowing multiple users to bid on a particular
product. The seller retains the freedom to choose the highest bidder for the sale
